Hi everyone — I just deployed a new MVP project: **AI Assisted Interview**.

I built it because I was looking for a better way to practice interview questions and also wanted to experiment with **Gemini integration**, while sharpening my **React + Supabase** skills.

## What it does
- Practice technical interview questions by subject
- Submit your answer and get **instant AI feedback + a score**
- Simple interview flow + results you can review

## Tech stack
- Frontend: **React (Vite) + TypeScript + MUI**
- Backend: **Node.js + Express + TypeScript**
- Auth/DB: **Supabase**
- AI: **Google Gemini**

## Hosting
- Server (Render):
  - https://ai-assisted-interview.onrender.com
  - Health check: https://ai-assisted-interview.onrender.com/health
- Client UI (Netlify):
  - https://ai-assisted-interview-client-ui.netlify.app/
- Admin UI (Netlify):
  - https://ai-assisted-interview-admin-ui.netlify.app/

## Want to try it?
Please send me a DM with:
- Your email address
- A short access request (so I can create an account for you)

In return, I’d really appreciate your feedback. While keeping in mind this is a fully functional MVP, I’ll be adding more content and questions in the coming days.

Thanks for reading!
